Individuals will be able to submit their own hands to expand the Applied Hand Dimensions data base.

The Process for submitting a hand will go as follows:

1. Make measurements of the hand following the masurment [Instructions](https://github.com/OSUrobotics/Applied-Hand-Dimensions/tree/main/Instructions)
2. Take a photo of the hand for each measurment, including the measurment device.
3. Fill out the submition application, which includes entering the measurments and providing the photos for each measurement.
4. The application will be reviewed to ensure the measurements were propperly done and if so they will be added to the data base.
	* If the measurements are found to not be at a satisfactory level then the applicant will be notified and can resubmit with updated measurements.


Once an application is accepted A folder for the specific hand will be generated containing four markdown files and an Images folder.<br>
	Markdown Files:<br>
		* `<hand name>` Power Grasp Measurements.md - Shows the pictures of each measurement and the recorded measurement values.<br>
		* `<hand name>` Precision Grasp Measurements.md - Shows the pictures of each measurement and the recorded measurement values.<br>
		* `<hand name>` Width Measurements.md - Shows the pictures and recorded values for the width measurements.<br>

Images Folder:<br>
