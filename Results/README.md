<!--Individuals will be able to submit their own hands to expand the Applied Hand Dimensions data base. -->

### Overview

After the measurements, following the [Instructions](https://github.com/OSUrobotics/Applied-Hand-Dimensions/tree/main/Instructions), have been completed for a new hand the results will be stored in this directory along with the images of the measurments.

<!---
1. Make measurements of the hand following the masurement [Instructions](https://github.com/OSUrobotics/Applied-Hand-Dimensions/tree/main/Instructions)
2. Take a photo of the hand for each measurment, including the measurment device.
3. Fill out the submition application, which includes entering the measurments and providing the photos for each measurement.
4. The application will be reviewed to ensure the measurements were propperly done and if so they will be added to the data base.
	* If the measurements are found to not be at a satisfactory level then the applicant will be notified and can resubmit with updated measurements.
-->

Once a new hand is uploaded a new folder for the specific hand will be generated containing four markdown files and an Images folder.<br>
	Markdown Files:<br>
		* Power Grasp Measurements.md - Shows the pictures of each measurement and the recorded measurement values.<br>
		* Precision Grasp Measurements.md - Shows the pictures of each measurement and the recorded measurement values.<br>
		* Width Measurements.md - Shows the pictures and recorded values for the width measurements.<br>
		* Results.md - Shows a table and plot for each grasp.

Images Folder:<br>
	Stores all of the submitted images for that hand.

### Future Work

The long term goal is for this repository to become a database containing the measurments for a broad selection of hands. To accomplish this, an application proccess will be added allowing third parties to submit measurements of hands that they wish to add.  This system will be added at the soonest possible date.
