## Suggestions for Making the Measurements

If you have access to a CAD model that has propper actuation then you may find it easier and more accurate to conduct the measurements in a CAD enviroment.

If you plan to conduct the measaurements on the physical hand here are some suggestions to make the measuring proccess easier:
  
  * Two rulers can be used as seen in the Model O Precision Grasp measurments, which were done in CAD but shows the use of two rulers.
    
    * The ruler used to measure the span also represents the span line, so if a second ruler is place on the depth axis the depth measurement can be made.
  
  * Instead of using two rulers the span line could be represented by attaching a rubber ban to the two distals at their midpoints.
    
    * The rubber ban would represent the span line allowing a single ruler to measure depth.
  
  * For some of the underactuated hands it may be easier to actually grab an object to get the fingers into the correct oreientation.
    
    * Objects that are able to deform some would work well, allowing the user better control of the finger orientation.
